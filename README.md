# Mail-Merge

This project is a simple program that creates letters to a number of predetermined guests.

This project takes a letter template and a list of names, and creates a separate text file for each named person with their names in the appropriate spots in their letters.

To run main.py, you will need the provided Input folder with the required files (you can change these files to suit your needs), and an Output file in which it is optional to have the provided file.
